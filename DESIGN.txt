Consumer Tempting, ear popping, name:         ****** O'Houlihan's Revenge *******
    Inspired by one of the greatest films of all time, "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story", O'Houlihan's Revenge is the
    journey of a novice dodgeballer driven by the desire to avenge his mentor Pathches O'Houlihan's "accidental" death.

Goal:
    There are two levels/game modes.

    1) The first level is when Patches O'Houlihan is training our young dodgeballer.  In this level, the goal is to
    survive Patches' harsh training tactics, summarized by his famous 5 D's of dodgeball catch phrase
    "Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge". In order to pass training you must evade patches' attempts to
    destroy your 3 lives.  If you are hit by a ball you will lose a life or two respectively.  However if you survive     the allotted time you will be deemed worthy and allowed to advance to... level 2!

    2) The second level is after the tragic "accident" of Patches' death. In this level you are battling against the
    evil owner of Globogym, White Goodman, in the Las Vegas dodgeball tournament. Here you are trying to defeat
    White Goodman by decreasing his lives. Unfairly, Goodman is wearing 'armor' which means that hitting him a single
    time won't destory him, however if he hits you a single time you lose the game. If you manage to hit him with        enough of your own dodgeballs before the time runs out you win!!!
